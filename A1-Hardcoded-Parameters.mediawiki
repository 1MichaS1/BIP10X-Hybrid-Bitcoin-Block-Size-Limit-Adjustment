===A.1 Overview of BIP10X's Hardcoded Parameters and Design Choices===

====Voting and direct Block Size Limit parameters:====

* 75% = miner majority for BIP10X activation

* 50% = 50% of BIP101 miners are contributing to the BIP10X activation condition

* 80% = majority determining the initial BSL (i.e. 20% quantile)

* 50% = quantile (median) for normal BSL adjustment

* 80% = majority (20% and 80% quantile) for accelerated BSL adjustment 

* 1MB = min. value for initial BSL

* 4MB = max. value for initial BSL

* 1,000,000 byte = floor(2^(0/8) * 1 MB) = absolute minimum BSL

* 60,096,776,975 byte= floor(2^(127/8) * 1 MB) <nowiki>[~ 60.1 GB]</nowiki> = absolute maximum BSL

* 3,938,502,375,863,834 byte= floor(2^(255/8) * 1 MB) <nowiki>[~ 3939 TB]</nowiki> = absolute maximum BSL when activating a yet reserved bit (by simple hard-fork in a very distant future)

* 2^(1/8) <nowiki>[~1.090508]</nowiki> = step increment factor of possible BSL values

* 2^(6/8) <nowiki>[~1.6818]</nowiki> = greatest instantaneous BSL adjustment step factor (in either direction)

* 1008 blocks initial voting interval

* 1008 blocks normal voting interval

* 2016..3023 blocks grace period length

====Block Size Limit averaging and constraints:====

* 32244/32768 <nowiki>[~0.984]</nowiki> = Forgetting_factor determining “average” BSL, which is the basis for limiting the long-term growth of the BSL. It corresponds to an effective window length of<br>1/(1-0.984) ~ 62.5 weeks ~ 1.2 years

* 189/128=1.4765625 = Parameter limiting the max. long-term growth of BSL to ca. 41% p.a. (together with above forgetting factor) under “normal voting conditions”

* 110/128=0.8593750 = Parameter limiting the max. long-term decline of BSL to ca. ‑8% p.a. (together with above forgetting factor) under “normal voting conditions”

* 247/128=1.9296875 = Parameter limiting the max. long-term growth of BSL to ca. 100% p.a. (together with above forgetting factor) in case of >80% miner up-vote

* 98/128=0.7656250 = Parameter limiting the max long-term decline of BSL to ca. ‑16% p.a. (together with above forgetting factor) in case of >80% miner down-vote

* <nowiki>[39704/32768 ; 150244/32768] ~[1.21;4.59]</nowiki> = Range relative to the average actual block size of the last voting period (=1008 blocks). The effective BSL vote is forced to lie within this range.

====Overbooking of blocks:====

* 16383/16384 = 0.99993896484375 = Forgetting factor for calculating average overbooked blocks ratio. It corresponds to an eff. window length of 114 days = 16.25 weeks = 1/3 year.

* 2 = max. overbooking factor for up to 30% overbooking

* 30% = max. ratio of overbooked blocks 

* 4 = max. overbooking factor for up to 10% overbooking

* 10% = max. ratio of blocks overbooked by more than factor 2

* 25% = fraction of “excess” TX fees to be burned for overbooked blocks.

====bitcoin.conf default parameters:====

* 1.7a = default parameter of blocksizelimitvote

* 2.0 = default parameter of blockoverbookingtendency
