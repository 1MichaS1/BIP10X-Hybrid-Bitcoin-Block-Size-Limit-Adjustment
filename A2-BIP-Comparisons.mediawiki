===A.2 Comparison of Different Block Size Evolution Proposals===

Here is a concise comparison table, based on [https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-July/009808.html this] and further extended:

----

====Block size limit evolution mechanism:====

[1] BIP100:	UP/DOWN	miner voting

[2] BIP101: UP	fixed exponential growth schedule

[3] BIP102:	FIX	constant block size limit

[4] BIP103:	UP	fixed exponential growth schedule

[x] BIP10X:	UP/DOWN	miner voting and actual block size; plus short-term adaptation to temporary peaks.

----

====Block Size Limit growth/decline:====

[1] BIP100:	By miner voting, x0.5 – x2.0 every 12000 blocks (~3 months)
:: --> max growth rate: +1982% p.a. (x20.82 p.a.)
:: --> max decline rate: ‑95.2% p.a. (x0.048 p.a.)

[2] BIP101:	Fixed growth rate: +41.4% p.a. = +100% every 2 years

[3] BIP102:	+/‑0% p.a. (2 MByte static)

[4] BIP103:	Fixed growth rate: +17.7% p.a. = +100% every 4.3 years (+4.4% every 97 days) 

[x] BIP10X:	Depending on actual block size and miner's votes (median of all votes),
:: long-term growth/decline rate restricted to	max. +41% p.a. / ‑8% p.a.
:: = +100% in 2 years / ‑50% in 8 years.
:: With 80% miner support, maximum rates get pushed to	+100% p.a. / ‑16% p.a.

----

====Voting abuse possible by miner minority:====

[1] BIP100:	Yes, miner minority (~20%) can enforce excessive BSL decline of ca. ‑95% p.a.

[2] BIP101:	No (no miner vote)

[3] BIP102:	No (no miner vote)

[4] BIP103:	No (no miner vote)

[x] BIP10X:	No, a miner minority making excessive votes in either direction has no effect at all.

----

====Voting abuse possible by miner majority:====
[1] BIP100:	Yes, may enforce excessive growth/decline rate of ca. +2000% p.a. or -95% p.a.

[2] BIP101:	No (no miner vote)

[3] BIP102:	No (no miner vote)

[4] BIP103:	No (no miner vote)

[x] BIP10X:	Limited: Miner vote can influence growth/decline rate only within [-16%..+100%] p.a.
:: But if actual block size does not keep pace with miner vote, even a 100% miner vote
:: cannot change the block size limit.

----

====Risk due to “lazy” miner operators who keep bitcoin.conf unmodified:====

[1] BIP100:	?? - Default voting mechanism not specified.

[2] BIP101:	No (no miner vote)

[3] BIP102:	No (no miner vote)

[4] BIP103:	No (no miner vote)

[x] BIP10X:	No. Default parameter causes reasonable vote for ca. 1.63 times avg. actual block size

----

====Block Size Limit at initiation:====

[1] BIP100:	1MB 

[2] BIP101:	>=8MB (dpdt. on time of initiation, 0.7% increase per week, 100% per 2 years ) 

[3] BIP102:	2MB 

[4] BIP103:	1MB

[x] BIP10X:	1-4 MB dpdt. on miner vote in 1st voting week (takes minimum of top 80% votes)

----

====Final Block Size Limit --> and when is it reached:====

[1] BIP100:	<= 32 MB -->	can slow down/stop/reduce by miner vote

[2] BIP101:	8192 MB -->	2036-01-06		

[3] BIP102:	2 MB -->	2015-11-11

[4] BIP103:	2048 MB -->	2063-07-09

[x] BIP10X:	<= 60.1 GB -->	can slow down/stop/reduce by miner vote or permanently small blocks
:: (theoretically in 2043 w/o 80% miner support, or 2029 with 80% miner
:: support, but will never happen if actual blocks are not sufficiently filled)

----

====“Elasticity” of block sizes in case of temporary high TX load:====

[1] BIP100: No (fastest reaction time = x2 increase every 3 months)

[2] BIP101: No (fixed growth rate)

[3] BIP102: No (constant 2 MB)

[4] BIP103: No (fixed growth rate)

[x] BIP10X: Yes, immediate up to 4x block size limit “overbooking” allowed in exceptional cases,
:: but associated with a counter-incentive to avoid abuse. [Rat‑7]

----

====Miner voting used to initiate the hard fork?====

[1] BIP100: Yes, support with 10800 out of last 12000 blocks (90%)

[2] BIP101: Yes, support with 750 out of last 1000 blocks (75%)

[3] BIP102: No

[4] BIP103: No

[x] BIP10X: Yes, support with 756 out of last 1008 blocks (75%); BIP101 blocks counted by 50%

----

====When does the hard fork happen?====

[1] BIP100:	>=2016-01-11, after 90% miner support

[2] BIP101:	>=2016-01-11, two weeks after 75% miner support

[3] BIP102:	2015-11-11

[4] BIP103:	2017-01-01

[x] BIP10X:	>=today, 2-3 weeks after 75% miner support
