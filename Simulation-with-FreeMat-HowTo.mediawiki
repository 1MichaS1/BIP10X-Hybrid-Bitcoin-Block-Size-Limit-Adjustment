==How to Use FreeMat Tool for the Simulations==

Simulations were done using FreeMat 4.0. FreeMat is freely available under GPLv2 license for all major operating systems. To execute this simulation script, do the following steps:

* Copy-paste the source code below to an empty text editor window and save as “BSL_change.m” or any other file name ending with “.m” (file name has only letters, numbers and underscore, first character is a letter).

* Install FreeMat 4.0 or later.

* Start up FreeMat. You see the GUI as shown in the screenshot below.

** Browse <span style="color:red">(1)</span> to the director where your file “BSL_change.m” is located. You can also use “cd” command like in the console of your operating system.

** Type <span style="color:red">(2)</span> “edit BSL_change.m” <ENTER> to open the file in an m-file editor with syntax highlighting.

** Modify the parameters as desired, in the parameter section of “BSL_change.m”.

** Type <span style="color:red">(3)</span> “BSL_change” <ENTER> to execute the script which starts the simulation.
